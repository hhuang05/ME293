\section{Physical System} \label{sec:physys}

%% Description of the problem you are trying to solve and the states you
%% are trying to control; description of the performance goal(s) you seek
%% to achieve through controller/estimator design.

I will continue to use the physical system taken from Bryson
\cite{bryson2015control} of a Boeing 747 aircraft. The aircraft's
dynamics were linearlized for straight and level flight around the
reference altitude of 40000 feet and a horizontal velocity of Mach 0.8 (774
$\frac{ft}{sec}$). 

%% The physical system is of a Boeing 747 aircraft and I want to
%% design a controller for the aircraft to maintain straight and level
%% flight. Due to the nonlinear coupling between airspeed and altitude,
%% slight changes in the pitch of the aircraft may lead to an eventual
%% large deviation from the cruising altitude. For this reason, this type
%% of controller is useful to control the aircraft to maintain cruising
%% altitude. I will focus on pole placement of the open loop system so as
%% to meet performance goals. In addition, I want to investigate how the
%% linear assumptions of the physical system responds to nonlinear
%% dynamics in simulation.

\subsection{System Description}

For aircraft, the kinematic equations of motion is written with
reference to two sets of axes, the inertial frame and the body
frame. The inertial frame lies outside the aircraft, usually it is a
reference fixed with respect to the earth. The body frame has its
origins at the center of mass of the aircraft, with the x-axis
pointing forward towards the nose, z-axis pointing down from the body
and the y-axis is perpenticular going out towards the right wing. An
example of these two sets of axes and the associated rotation is
pictured in Figure \ref{fig:euler}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \ig{scale=0.4}{eulerangles.png}
  \caption{The three Euler angles $\psi, \theta$ and $\phi$ govern the
  rotation of the body axes into the inertial axes}
  \label{fig:euler}
\end{figure}
From these two sets of references, we define the kinematic equations
for an aircraft as follows:
\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \dot x \\
    \dot y \\
    \dot z \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  &=
  T_{\psi}T_{\theta}T_{phi}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    u \\
    v \\
    w \\
  \end{bmatrix} \\
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \dot \phi \\
    \dot \theta \\
    \dot \psi \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  &=
  (\frac{1}{c \theta})
  \begin{bmatrix}
    c \theta & s\theta s \phi & s \theta c \phi \\
    0 & c \theta c \phi & -c \theta s \phi \\
    0 & s \phi & c \phi\\
  \end{bmatrix} 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    p \\
    q \\
    r \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $T_{\psi}, T_{\theta}, T_{\phi}$ are the appropriate rotation
matrices based on the three Euler angles: $\psi, \theta,
\phi$.
\item $x,y,z$ are the inertial frame coordinates.
\item $u,v,w$ are the body frame coordinates.
\item $p,q,r$ are the roll, pitch and yaw rates.
\end{itemize}

\todo[inline]{Need fix}
Your second and third assumptions are tied together.  You cannot linearize without assuming a reference condition.  In this case, you have assumed a reference condition of straight and level flight.

 -- but they
are when linearizing about a straight-and-level flight reference
condition.

I made several assumptions to the aerodynamic forces to reduce the
order of the problem. The first assumption is that
the aerodynamic forces can be approximated by linear functions for
small perturbations around the reference condition. Although
longitudinal and lateral dynamics are not always decoupled,
linearizing around a reference condition does mean that longitudinal and lateral dynamics
can be de-coupled and treated independently. The second assumption is that this
system has thrust and the elevator as the only control inputs
into the system. With these two assumptions, the states in the system
are: $[u, w, q, \theta, z, x]$, with control inputs $[\delta e$,
  $\delta t]$.

For steady rectilinear flight $\dot u = \dot w = \dot q = \dot \theta =
0$. We can use the following linearized dynamic equations for $\dot x$
and $\dot z$:
\begin{align}
  \dot x &= u \\
  \dot z &= -w + u_0 \theta 
\end{align}
The linearlized state space model is presented as follows: 
\begin{align*}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \dot u \\
    \dot w \\
    \dot q \\
    \dot \theta \\
    \dot z \\
    \dot x \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  &=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -.003 & .039 & 0 & -.322 & 0 & 0 \\
    -.065 & -.319 & 7.74 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    .0201 & -.101 & -.429 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -1 & 0 & 7.74 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix} 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    u \\
    w \\
    q \\
    \theta \\
    z \\
    x \\
  \end{bmatrix} \\
  &+  
  \begin{bmatrix}
    .01 & 1 \\
    -.18 & -.04 \\
    -1.16 & .598 \\
    0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \delta_{e} \\
    \delta_{t} \\
  \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{align*}

\subsection{Performance Goals} \label{subsec:perfgoals}

There are two performance goals that I am interested in. The optimatl
estimator shall:
\begin{description}
\item [A] Have an average absolute error that is less than 10 fee in
  its estimate of current altitude. 
\item [B] Be able to complete the estimation within 0.01 second.
\end{description}
