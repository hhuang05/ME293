\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this project, I have compared the Kalman Filter and the Particle
Filter using 1000 particles. There were two performance goals, 1)
the estimator shall minimize average absolute estimation error and 2)
the estimator shall perform the estimation within 0.01 second. The
Particle Filter met the first goal while failling the second and the
Kalman Filter failed the first goal while meeting the second. This
shows that there are complex trade-offs which one needs to consider
when choosing to use either filter.
