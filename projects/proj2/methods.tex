Both filters were The particle filter used 1000 particles and ran the filter for
10,000 steps, with a sampling rate of $\frac{1}{100}$ sec for each
step. 

In order to assess average estimator error, 

Ran the Kalman filter 1000 times with the same initial conditions,
much like how we would initialize a particle filter. However,
