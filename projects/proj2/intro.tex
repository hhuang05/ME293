Jet fuel is expensive. In fact, according to the International Air
Transport Association (IATA), the cost of jet fuel in 2012 for the
airline industry accounted for 33\% of operating expenses. In the past
few years the cost of fuel has come down and the situation has improved
a little for airlines. However, even though the airline currently
enjoy higher profits due to lower oil prices, this is no guaranteed
that this trend can continue. 

Aircraft manufacturers understand this economic reality. New planes
are designed with fuel economy as one of the most important
features. For engineers designing controllers, controlling the plane
during cruise altitude is very important as the plane spends most of
its trip there. In order to control the altitude, engineers need a very
accurate estimate. Therefore, in this report I will compare the
performance of two estimators, the Kalman Filter and the Particle
Filter. Specifically, I'm looking for an estimator which has an
average absolute error of less than 10 feet in its estimate of current
altitude.
