\section{Data sets} \label{sec:data}

%% Description of the data sets you are using, whether based on
%% simulations or experiment; how models will be used to design and test
%% your feedback controller.

\subsection{Tracking state variables}

In order to assess the performance of both the Kalman and the Particle
Filters, simulations were performed in MATLAB. These simulations
used linear dynamics with process and sensor noise . The continous state space system was
discretized through the \texttt{c2d} command using a time step of
$\frac{1}{100}$ of a second for zero-order hold. As the
initial condition, I defined a reference state $x_{ref}$ with the
same conditions that was used to linearize the model:
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{x}_{ref} &=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    u = 774 \\
    w = 0 \\
    q = 0 \\
    \theta = 0 \\
    z = 40000 \\
    x = 774t\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
Using the process and sensor noise matrices $Q$ and $R$ defined
in equations (\ref{eq:processnoise}) and (\ref{eq:sensornoise}), I
then derive the estimator gain matrix $L$ for both filters:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:estgain}
  L =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.0000  &  0.0030 &   0.0045  &   0.0013 \\
    -0.0004  &  0.0004 &  -0.0080  &  -0.0409\\
    0.0000  &  0.0000 &   0.0009  &  0.0026\\
    0.0000  &  0.0001 &   0.0002  &  0.0012 \\
    0.0003  &  0.0000 &   0.0047  &  0.0315 \\
    0.0000  &  0.0077 &   0.0046  &  0.0046 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
The estimator gain matrix derived above was used for both Kalman and
Particle filters.

\subsection{Comparing Mean Estimator Error}

To satistify performance goal A and assess average estimator error, I
developed a simulation scenario which involved a reduction in altitude of 20
feet and the simulation ran for a total of 100 seconds. For the Kalman
Filter, this simulation was run 1000 times to generate a
distribution of errors in the estimator due to process and sensor
noise. For the particle filter, the scenario was only ran once, but as
it used 1000 particles, this seemed to be an equivalent comparison to
the Kalman filter executing 1000 times.

\subsection{Comparing Time of Execution}

To satistify performance goal B and assess average estimation times,
the MATLAB functions \texttt{tic} and \texttt{toc} were used to time the
execution of each filter at each step.
