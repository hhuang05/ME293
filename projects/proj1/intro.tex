Jet fuel is expensive. In fact, according to the International Air
Transport Association (IATA), the cost of jet fuel in 2012 for the
airline industry accounted for 33\% of operating expenses. In the past
few years the cost of fuel has come down and the situation has improved
a little for airlines. However, even though the airline currently
enjoy higher profits due to lower oil prices, this is no guaranteed
that this trend can continue. 

Aircraft manufacturers understand this economic reality. New planes
are designed with fuel economy as one of the most important features. 

How does this apply to control. 



Problem could be that current fuel prices are low, which may force
airlines to rethink how they control their aircraft. Whereas a few
years ago fuel prices were extremely high, so you want a control
scheme that minimizes fuel consumption for maximum profit. These
days, as fuel prices are so low, one could rethink this control
scheme.

To investigate how effect of cheap vs expensive control in the
LQR controller on the behavior of the dynamics of an airspeed-hold
controller.
