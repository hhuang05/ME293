\section{Data sets} \label{sec:data}

%% Description of the data sets you are using, whether based on
%% simulations or experiment; how models will be used to design and test
%% your feedback controller. 

Data sets were derived from simulation in Matlab. The dynamics system was
discretized into time steps of $\frac{1}{100}$ of a second and simulated.
